## Future Scope

This project is a basic e-commerce website which can be enhanced by including an additional website that can act as a dashboard which can allow suppliers and distributors to manage inventory and view analytics regarding sales and the website itself. Multiple modes of authentication and payment can be added to increase user convinience.
